	<h1>Case study: label and focus()</h1>

	<p>This is a run-through of one developer's approach to Test the Web Forward.
	It will show you ways you can be involved, some of the challenges you may face, and the reward at the end.</p>


	<h2>Scenario</h2>

	<p>While exploring <a href="case-study-label-contenteditable.html">case study: label and contenteditable</a> I wound up with another issue.
	My tests involved the use of <code>focus()</code> and <code>click()</code> to test whether a label that was contenteditable kept focus or passed it to the associated form control.</p>

	<p>All of the tests failed in Firefox. Why?</p>

	<p>View the tests: <a href="http://codepen.io/bboyle/pen/MwPXMq">codepen: label@contenteditable tests</a></p>

	<h2>Narrowing down the issue</h2>

	<p>I did some testing to isolate what was failing. I tried a couple of things in a test page using the developer console. I compared <code>label</code> elements with <code>div</code> (a pretty generic element). I kept <code>contenteditable="true"</code> on both in case that related to them being able to receive focus. I event started to experiment with <code>tabindex="-1"</code> (to allow them to get focus) but decided that was introducing more variables rather than narrowing it down. I'm happy with the simple test case I ended up with:</p>

	<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

	<p>In Firefox, <code>document.activeElement</code> is set to the <code>div</code> after calling <code>focus()</code>, but this does not work on the <code>label</code>. Note that manually clicking on the element with the mouse <em>does</em> set <code>document.activeElement</code>. So, this test is specifically about calling <code>focus()</code> in JavaScript, on a <code>label</code> that is <code>contenteditable</code>. Now I know what to research in the specifications!</p>

	<h2>Check the spec</h2>

	<h3>focus()</h3>

	<p>I started with <code>document.activeElement</code> and read the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/activeElement">MDN page Document.activeElement</a>. Please note that MDN itself is not an official specification—but can be a good place to learn from. A link to formal specifications is always included at the end of the content and links to <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#dom-document-activeelement">the definition of 'activeElement' in the HTML Living Standard</a>. Even better, scrolling up a bit reveals this to be part of <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-management-apis">6.4.6 Focus management APIs</a>—that sounds promising!</p>

	<p>The key parts I read—and <em>my understanding of them</em>—are</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><code>document.activeElement</code></dt>
		<dd>This property should reference the element that has focus, at all times.</dd>

		<dt><code>element.focus()</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to set focus on any element.</dd>

		<dt>focusable-area</dt>
		<dd>There are notes specific to some elements, but nothing about <code>label</code> that I can tell. The final entry in the table is about "any other element" and that seems to apply to my test case.</dd>

		<dt>focusing steps, focus update steps</dt>
		<dd>Whew, there is a lot of detail here! Some of it is familiar, such as the <code>focus</code> event we can use our scripts. The part about a <i>defined activation behaviour</i> was interesting, but related to the <code>input</code> element, not <code>label</code>.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>I haven't seen anything that contradicts my expectations yet. I also need to change if there is any behaviour defined for <code>label</code> or <code>contenteditable</code> which relates to <code>focus</code>.</p>

	<h3>label</h3>

	<h3>contenteditable</h3>
