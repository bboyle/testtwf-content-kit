	<h1>Test the Web Forward content kit</h1>

	<p><a href="http://testthewebforward.org/">Test the Web Forward</a> is W3C's one stop shop for Open Web Platform testing. In this content kit we will help you teach developers what they need to know to get involved.</p>

	<p>Please file any issues you find against <a href="https://github.com/bboyle/testtwf-content-kit">this content kit's github repo</a>.</p>

	</ul>


	<h2>Who is this content kit for?</h2>

	<p>Test the Web Forward is ideally suited to authors with experience working closely with the browser APIs. Their expertise may be broad across a number of areas (e.g. DOM) or specific to one particular specification. Library/polyfill authors in particular have detailed implementation knowledge that would be useful for contributing to interoperability tests.</p>

	<h3>How can you help?</h3>

	<p>You may be more ready than you think. If you have:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>posted a question on stackoverflow asking why browser A behaves differently to browser B</li>
		<li>raised a bug report for a particular browser</li>
		<li>written code that polyfills a web specification for one or more browsers</li>
		<li>blogged, spoken or taught about a web specification</li>
		<li>created a demo to show off features of a web standard</li>
		<li>experience writing tests.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Great! You're already thinking critically about interoperability. We could use your help at Test the Web Forward. You can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>review the existing tests</li>
		<li>raise an issue for inconsistent behaviour in browsers</li>
		<li>write a new test demonstrating bugs you've found</li>
		<li>port tests you have already written.</li>
	</ul>
